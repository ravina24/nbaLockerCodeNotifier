This program was created to notify my friends and I whenever nba2k released new locker codes at https://www.nba2k.io/nba-2k20-locker-codes/. 
These locker codes are only available for a certain window of time, ranging from an about an hour to a week and can be used in game to win prizes, such as player packs.

This script has been scheduled to run every hour (20 minutes past the hour) using pythonanywhere.com. 
If new locker codes have been released, they will be texted to my friends and I.
